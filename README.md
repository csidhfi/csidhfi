#Overview

This archive contains the following 
- `simulation` contains the simulation scripts used in Section 4 of the paper.
  If you have Python3 installed, then these should allow you to reproduce the 
  results in the paper. 
  For more details see [simulation/README.md](./simulation/README.md) 

- `attack` contains the attack scripts used in Section 5 of the paper.
  If you have a ChipWhisperer-Lite (CW1173) 32-bit basic board which features 
  a STM32F303 (and a little bit of time), you can reproduce the results 
  presented in the paper by simply running our attack script.  
  For more details see [attack/README.md](./attack/README.md) 
  
- `benchmark` contains our implementation with and without countermeasures
  together with a benchmarking framework which allows to reproduce the results
  of Section 7 of the paper.
  In addition to the STM32F303, it also supports the popular STM32F407.  
  For more details see [benchmark/README.md](./benchmark/README.md)
